## Portfolio Description
<p>
    Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is Leandro Gamarra. Welcome to my documented process of how I built my very own Portfolio Website. What drove me to build this website, was the sense of not having a way where possible recruiters could learn more about who I am as a person and a place where they could see what projects I've built, all in one place. Yes, they could look at my resume, but I think it'd be better to have a visual of my resume, which is what I did with this website. I hope you enjoy my website.
</p>

## Website Background
<p>
    The way I set up my Portfolio was in into five sections: About Me, Projects, Experience, Education, and Technology. My website follows this order because of the importance of each section. In the About Me section I talk about who I am, where I come from, and what my aspirations are once I graduate college. In the Projects section, I display some of my top applications/websites that I feel most proud of and want to showcase. The Experience section contains all courses and internships I've taken and been a part of related to Computer Science. Moreover, the Education section displays my education after college and any accomplishments that I got in each college. Lastly, the Technology section displays some of the websites and applicatons that I used when I am building iOS apps and websites.
</p>

## Development Process
- ### Figma Design
    - To begin, as I do in any project, before I get to the coding section, I like to visualize what I want my finished project to look like. Therefore, I began to put my ideas of my project and features that I want to include in the Figma design below. I separated my design into two stages: Initial, and Final Design. You can see the difference between the two. In the official website, I tweaked a few things, but overall I loved how the final design came out.
        - #### Initial Design

## Final Website
- Finally!! I'm extremely happy with how my Portfolio Website came out. Now, when I'm applying to new internships/full-time roles, I have a solid website where recruites can get a glimpse into who I am as a person and programmer.

## App Technology
This website has been built using HTML/CSS and Javascript.

## Future Features
In terms of future features, I'd like to create a new html page just for my projects section because as I began adding more projects, the Projects section will get too long, therefore having it in it's own page will be better. Also, a new page will enable me to go further into more detail into explaining what each project is and it's features.

## Wrap Up
To sum up, I've been planning on making this website for some time now, but never got around to it. I'm glad I did and I like how it came out.
